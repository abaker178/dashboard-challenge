UCSD Data Science Bootcamp - Plotly Dashboard Homework

## Purpose
Build practice and confidence in working with Plotly and building Dashboards. This project is fictional and for academic purposes.

## Premise
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Timeline
This project will likely not have many updates going forward.
